NAME
    Acme::Your - not our variables, your variables

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::Dumper;
        use Acme::Your "Data::Dumper";

        your $Varname;  # This is really $Data::Dumper::Varname

        print "The default variable name for DD is $Varname";

DESCRIPTION
    Acme::Your gives you a language construct "your" that behaves similarly
    to Perl's own "our" constuct. Rather than defining lexically unqualified
    varibles to be in our own package however, you can define lexically
    unqualified variable to be from anothter package namespace entirely.

    It all starts with the use statement.

        use Acme::Your "Some::Package";

    This both 'imports' the your construct and states the package that any
    variables defined with a your statement will be created in.

    Then you can do 'your' statements. Note that these are lexical, and fall
    out of scope much the same way that our variables would. For example

        use Acme::Your "Fred"

        my $foo = "bar";

        {
            your $foo = "wilma";
            print $foo;  # prints "wilma"
        }

        print $foo;      # prints "foo"
        print $Fred::foo # prints "wilma"

    Your allows you to import symbols from other packages into your own
    lexical scope and have access to them.

BUGS
    Acme::Your functions by parsing your source code and filtering it with a
    source filter. It is possible to fool the parser with some pathelogical
    cases and you should be aware that this module faces all the standard
    problems that perl faces when parsing Perl Code.
